# Content Analysis Final Project
Social media has become increasingly important in consumers’ daily lives. Most consumer brands have been present on social media platforms and the sources of communication are no longer purely from the brands. Many forms of communications have enriched brand-consumer relationships. Besides traditional paid media (paid or sponsored display advertisements), brands’ presence on social media allows them to not only to publish brand-related content, but also to interact with users to create a brand persona with desired brand personalities (owned media). Moreover, the characteristics of social media allow consumers to control what brand-related information is generated and shared and thus they are no longer the receivers or endorsers of brand messages, but the source of brand-related content, known as user-generated content (UGC). Previous empirical research papers have shown that UGC has signiﬁcant effects on brand images, purchase intentions, and sales, and thus UGC has become an important part of brand communications. 

## Research Question
This study aims to explore how the role of channel characteristics affects consumer creations of brand-related messages. Specifically, we investigate the following problems: (1) How do brand-related user generated contents (UGC) differ across theoretically categorized social media platforms? (2) what type of contents receive higher attention on social media? - can we predict the popularity of comments? 

## Data Source
Data: scraped and collected UGC data from three social media platforms: Twitter (self-media), Instagram (creative outlets), and Reddit (collaboration platforms).
